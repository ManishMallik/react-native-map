# react-native-map
This React Native project is a Trip Planner for anyone, especially for beginners who are traveling for their very first time and don't know exactly which particular locations or stops to
visit. They may know a few cities but not the stops within those cities to see.

This Trip Planner app provides recommended locations for users to go to based on where they want to go to and what kind of locations, if any, they want to go to. Users can choose from a
recommended list of locations provided by an AI assistant that takes in user input. These chosen locations will be displayed on a map, along with the user's starting location, and routes will
be drawn. Users can add or remove any stops from the map, view their recommended itinerary, and save the data of their planned trip so that they can reload it easily in the future.

This React Native project is to test my skills with React Native, mostly interacting with maps.
